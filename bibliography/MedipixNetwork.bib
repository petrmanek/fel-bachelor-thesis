abstract = "The \{ATLAS\} detector is now installed at the \{CERN\} \{LHC\} and a precise evaluation of the radiation environment within and around the detector is required to understand the performance of the various detector systems, and to predict their useful lifetime. Furthermore, validation of earlier Monte Carlo predictions about the radiation field in \{ATLAS\} is necessary. In particular, it is important to perform these measurements in the early phases of the \{LHC\} operation. Many other radiation measuring devices lack sensitivity to low doses, and usually do not provide information on the composition of the radiation during this low intensity period. A network of 15 ATLAS-MPX devices has been installed at various positions in the \{ATLAS\} detector. These devices are capable of providing quantitative real-time information on the fluxes and flux distributions of the main radiation types in the experiment, including slow and fast neutrons. The technical description of the ATLAS-MPX detector network as well as the principles of the data analysis is presented. "
