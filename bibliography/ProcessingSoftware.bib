abstract = "The semiconductor pixel detector Medipix2 [1] (256×256 square pixels, 55×55 μm2 each) is a superior imaging device in terms of spatial resolution, linearity and dynamic range. This makes it suitable for various applications such as radiography, neutronography, and micro–tomography. The software package for acquisition and data processing has been developed to control and manage complex measurements. The solution features an open and very flexible modular architecture with custom made plugin support. Plugins can control parts of the acquisition system as well as perform real-time data processing and use these results as feedback for controlling further steps of measurements. This allows us to control, e.g. data acquisition, position and rotation of the sample (stepper motors), source parameters, temperature, etc. in a synchronized way. An example is the adaptive tomography plugin which adaptively controls the measurement and benefits from preprocessing performed by other plugins such as the beam-hardening correction of measured projections.
