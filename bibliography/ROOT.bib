abstract = "The \{ROOT\} system in an Object Oriented framework for large scale data analysis. \{ROOT\} written in C++, contains, among others, an efficient hierarchical \{OO\} database, a C++ interpreter, advanced statistical analysis (multi-dimensional histogramming, fitting, minimization, cluster finding algorithms) and visualization tools. The user interacts with \{ROOT\} via a graphical user interface, the command line or batch scripts. The command and scripting language is C++ (using the interpreter) and large scripts can be compiled and dynamically linked in. The \{OO\} database design has been optimized for parallel access (reading as well as writing) by multiple processes. "
