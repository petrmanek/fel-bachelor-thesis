  abstract = "The \{ROOT\} system in an Object Oriented framework for large scale data analysis. \{ROOT\} written in C++, contains, among others, an efficient hierarchical \{OO\} database, a C++ interpreter, advanced statistical analysis (multi-dimensional histogramming, fitting, minimization, cluster finding algorithms) and visualization tools. The user interacts with \{ROOT\} via a graphical user interface, the command line or batch scripts. The command and scripting language is C++ (using the interpreter) and large scripts can be compiled and dynamically linked in. The \{OO\} database design has been optimized for parallel access (reading as well as writing) by multiple processes. "

  abstract = "The \{ATLAS\} detector is now installed at the \{CERN\} \{LHC\} and a precise evaluation of the radiation environment within and around the detector is required to understand the performance of the various detector systems, and to predict their useful lifetime. Furthermore, validation of earlier Monte Carlo predictions about the radiation field in \{ATLAS\} is necessary. In particular, it is important to perform these measurements in the early phases of the \{LHC\} operation. Many other radiation measuring devices lack sensitivity to low doses, and usually do not provide information on the composition of the radiation during this low intensity period. A network of 15 ATLAS-MPX devices has been installed at various positions in the \{ATLAS\} detector. These devices are capable of providing quantitative real-time information on the fluxes and flux distributions of the main radiation types in the experiment, including slow and fast neutrons. The technical description of the ATLAS-MPX detector network as well as the principles of the data analysis is presented. "

abstract = "The semiconductor pixel detector Timepix (256×256 pixels with pitch of 55 μm) is a successor of the Medipix2 device. Each Timepix pixel can be independently operated in one of three possible modes: (1) counting of the detected particles; (2) measurement of the particle energy; and (3) measurement of the time of interaction. The energy measurement in the second mode is performed via the determination of the “time-over-threshold” (TOT). The energy measurement with the Timepix detector in \{TOT\} mode requires knowledge of the energy calibration of each pixel of the matrix. Such calibration is very nonlinear in the low energy range and can be described by a surrogate function depending on four parameters. The determination of all these parameters can be performed by measurement and evaluation of the response of each pixel in at least four calibration points. The procedure is extremely demanding: it requires the analysis of at least 250 thousand spectra and the performance of 330 thousand least-squares fits. In this article, it is demonstrated that even better result can be achieved with only two or three calibration points halving the number of least-squares fits needed. The method is based on precise analysis of the shape of spectral peaks. The article also discusses the performance of energy calibrated device for spectrometry of heavy charged particles. "
